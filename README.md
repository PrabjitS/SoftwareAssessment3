This code creates a Help Desk Ticketing System that allows users to create tickets, respond to tickets, reopen tickets, display ticket statistics, and display ticket details. It does so by defining a Ticket class that contains various methods and attributes related to the creation, resolution, and reopening of tickets. It also defines various functions that call the Ticket class methods based on user input from a menu displayed to the user.

When the program is run, it displays the main menu to the user and prompts them to choose an option. Based on their choice, the program either creates a new ticket, responds to an existing ticket, reopens a closed ticket, displays ticket statistics, displays ticket details, or exits the program.

The Ticket class contains attributes such as ticket number, staff ID, creator name, contact email, description, response, and status. The class methods allow for the creation of a new ticket, resolution of a ticket, reopening of a closed ticket, and providing a response to a ticket. The class also contains a static method that displays ticket statistics.

Overall, this program provides a comprehensive ticketing system for a help desk and can be used to keep track of and manage user requests efficiently.
